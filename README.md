# TemoaPJM_File
SQL, SQLite, and config files for Temoa PJM model created for CMU EPP Projects F20 report
This model of the PJM electricity grid was created for a Carnegie Mellon University undergraduate senior capstone class in the Engineering and Public Policy Department. 
It finds the projected least cost grid mix to meet the goal of 80% grid carbon emissions reductions by 2050 (from 2005 levels) based on specified parameters. 
Running the Temoa software (found here:https://temoacloud.com/) with the sqlite file in this folder should yield the same results as those in the test_run.xls excel file. 
The sql file was used to compile the sqlite file and can be edited and recompiled to run the model with different inputs.
